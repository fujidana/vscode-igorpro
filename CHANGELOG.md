# Change Log

All notable changes to the `vscode-igorpro` extension will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Primitive "Provide Diagnostics" feature. Currently only top-level elements are checked.
- "Show all Symbol Definitions Within a Document" feature.
- "Show Definitions of a Symbol" feature
- Extend IntelliSense support to symobls in workspace.
  - Currently IntelliSense does not trace `#include` statements and thus it suggests all non-static functions and constants in workspaces.
  - Local variables and waves are not yet supported.
- Improve "Show all Symbol Definitions Within a Document" feature. A menu block and a picture declaration are now marked as symbols.
  
## [1.1.0] -- 2022-09-06

### Added

- symbol navigation inside a file, including breadcrumbs. Functions, macros, structures, and constants are marked as symbols.
- support of a file drop on an editor. The file path is automatically formatted as an `#include` statement.

### Changed

- Make IntelliSence context-sensitive (refer to "IV-1 â€” Working with Commands / Types of Commands" in the Igor Pro Manual).
  - Hists for built-in operartions are shown only at the beginning word of the command.
  - Hints for built-in functions are not shown at the beginning word of the command.
  - Hints are disabled when a word starts with a slash, `/`. Usually it is a flag of an operation.

### Fixed

- a minor bug in syntax highlighting rules.
